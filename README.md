SOH Aware Strategy for Battery Storage in Microgrid Power system
This Project Presents a multi-objective state of health (SOH) aware Energy Management System for the Battery Storage used in a Microgird (MG) power system
 The proposed SOH aware EMS can improve the battery lifespan, increase the operational efficiencies, and enhance the environmental sustainability of the MG system. 
Using the real time operational MG system data, the proposed  EMS strategy uses a feature importance analysis technique based on the SHAP analysis. 
THe results of analysis n in the EMS design results in a 17% decrease in the battery degradation proxy and a 16% decrease in the state of health loss. 
Besides, the proposed EMS results in a 3% decrease in the carbon footprint compared to the conventional Economic only EMS. Additionally, the daily operational metrics and the peak battery deterioration days deliver the necessary AI insights for the operational management of the battery energy of the advanced battery storage in MG system.
